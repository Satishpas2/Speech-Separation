
These Matlab scripts generate the two speaker and three speaker data used in
         John R. Hershey, Zhuo Chen, Jonathan Le Roux, and Shinji Watanabe.
         "Deep clustering: Discriminative embeddings for segmentation and separation."
          ICASSP, 2016
and later publications.
They start from Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ0) converted into wav files.
The scripts also use two functions from the voicebox matlab library (http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/voicebox/voicebox.html). In order to make sure that the generated files are exactly the same for everyone, we are now shipping two specific versions of these two functions together with our scripts.
